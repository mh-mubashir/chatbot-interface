                Our advising bot is designed to help you navigate the most common academic advising questions as a College of Engineering student. 
                Get answers to your questions anytime, anywhere. No waiting for office hours or scheduling appointments for common inquiries. 
                More personalized questions related to curriculum planning are best addressed by your academic advisor.
              </p>
              <p>
                To get started, click the bot icon located in the bottom left corner of your screen and select your student status 
                (undergraduate or graduate). Then follow the prompts to find the information you need. If you select the wrong option 
                or want to return to the main menu, click &ldquo;back&rdquo; or &ldquo;start over.&rdquo;

                <strong className="text-gray-900">The Future of Advising Support:</strong> This advising bot currently uses a guided navigation system 
                to help you find resources quickly. Behind the scenes, our department is actively developing a full AI-powered implementation 
                that will offer more conversational and intelligent interactions. This advanced system is currently in testing and will be 
                released soon to provide an even more enhanced advising experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                This bot is an internal pilot program developed by the College of Engineering through the vision of the College Dean, 
                in collaboration with both Graduate and Undergraduate Advising Offices. With students located around the globe, 
                we wanted to ensure 24/7 access to essential resources regardless of time zone.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is just one of many COE-specific resources available to support students in meeting their academic goals; 
                the bot is designed to address the most common questions students ask, but it is not meant to replace our 
                advising services - you can schedule a meeting with an academic advisor anytime for personalized guidance. 
                Our collective mission is to provide equitable access to advising support and enhance the overall college experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                This advising bot is in its initial development phase, and we welcome student feedback to improve its usability and content. 
                Students can submit feedback by visiting our feedback form.
